# HAMMERWARS 2025 infrastructure

This codebase is a tangle of web-stuffs for HammerWars 2025. It's very bad in some respects, which is one reason I'm making it public -- so my friends can witness the atrocities I've committed.

There's a lot of other work outside of this repo for configuring the OS, importing problems into DOMJudge, the problems themselves, other art, etc.
